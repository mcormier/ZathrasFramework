Zathras.framework
==
-----
Zathras.framework is a Cocoa framework that will only include source code released
by Uli Kusterer.

[Uli Kusterer][1] has been releasing useful source code
for many years now. A full listing of what Uli
has released is available [here][2].

Currently Zathras.framework provides a wrapper for
UKKQueue with some slight modifications by myself.
