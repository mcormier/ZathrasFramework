Uli Kusterer has been releasing useful source code
for many years now. A full listing of what Uli
has released is available here.

Recently I found a need for UKKQueue, and decided
to wrap it in a framework instead of directly 
including the source files in my project.

So I created Zathras.framework.  I am also using
Uli's CrashReporter and may include it in the 
future.
